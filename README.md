# 🧠 AI-Powered Knowledge Base with Dynamic Answer Generation

## 💡 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent question-answering system using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The system retrieves relevant documents from a custom knowledge base and generates natural, context-aware answers using a language model.

It is designed to assist businesses in automating customer support by delivering fast, accurate, and document-grounded responses.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Retrieval
- Uses vector-based search with **FAISS** or **Elasticsearch** to find relevant documents from the knowledge base.
- Input documents can include customer manuals, FAQs, product guides, etc.

### 2. Answer Generation
- The system feeds the retrieved context along with the user query into a **transformer-based language model** (like T5 or GPT-3).
- The model outputs a well-formed, relevant, human-readable answer.
